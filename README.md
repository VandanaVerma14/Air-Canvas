# Air-Canvas
**Air Canvas** is a fun and interactive computer vision project built with **Python** and **OpenCV** that lets you draw in the air using only your webcam and colored objects (Red, Green, Blue). It uses real-time object detection and tracking to simulate a virtual whiteboard.
# Built With:
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
  
# Features
- Draw using **red**, **blue**, or **green** colored objects
- Eraser mode to remove parts of the drawing
- Adjustable **brush size** (1, 2, 3 keys)
- Save your drawing as an image file (press `S`)
- Clear the canvas anytime (press `C`)
- Real-time contour detection using webcam
# How it Works

- Detects colored markers using **HSV color filtering**
- Tracks the position of the markerâ€™s contour
- Uses that position to draw lines on a virtual canvas
- Combines the canvas with the live webcam feed
